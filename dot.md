We are very excited about the upcoming release of the [Polkadot Network](https://polkadot.network)!

For now we are waiting to become a delegate on the Kusama canary network in preparation for the launch.

We are buiding on 6 months of production expertise staking on the [Tezos mainnet](xtz.html). Our infrastructure is built according to the best practices and will be open-sourced soon.

## How to nominate to us

Follow the [Kusama nominator guide](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/mirror-maintain-guides-how-to-nominate-kusama).
