## What is Tezos ?

Tezos is a cryptocurrency. Specifically, it is a [delegated proof-of-stake cryptocurrency](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/DPoS).

[For more information, go to Tezos website](https://tezos.com).

## What is delegation ?

Delegation is like having your money in a savings account. By delegating to a baker like us, you help us bake more blocks and contribute to the health of the peer-to-peer network. Hodl.farm earns rewards for baking and endorsing blocks, and passes these rewards to you - minus a small fee.

If your XTZ are on Coinbase, Kraken or any online cryptocurrency exchange, you will not be able to delegate to us. To delegate, your assets must be in a wallet that you control.

## Is delegation safe ?

Delegation is an operation on the blockchain that does not change ownership of your assets. When you delegate to us, you still own your coins ! Let that sink in: delegating and transfering are two different things. Please do not send us money !

In order to delegate, you must be in control of your XTZ address, which means that you possess a private key which grants access to your assets. You must take precautions to protect your private key. Never send it to us, or anyone.

The most common protection is to use a hardware wallet such as Ledger or Trezor, or an offline, air-gapped device (running for example the AirGap app).

Being your own bank gives you great power. With great power comes great responsibility. When in doubt, do not attempt to delegate to us, leave your assets in a cryptocurrency website such as Coinbase, rumor has it that they will pay interest soon !

## How to delegate to us ?

We pride ourselves in being the one and only fully auditable cloud baker ! All our infrastructure resides on a distributed Google Kubernetes Engine cluster, with the exception of the signers, which are kept under our control.

We have nothing to hide! All of our infrastructure is declared as code and open-source.

We have built several layers of redundancy in the system, we have performed significant reliability and security due diligence.

## How can I contact you ?

## What are the terms of your Super Launch Discount ?

Tezos baking and endorsing rights depends on how many rolls a baker has. A roll amounts to 8000 tezzies. Going live, our baker has a little over one roll in own and delegated funds. We will give to our first delegators a low fee for life !

The breakdown of fees are:

* up to 2 rools (8,000 XTZ to 16,000 XTZ of delegated  funds) : a 5% fee until you stop delegating to us
* from 2 to 3 rolls (16,000 XTZ to 24,000 XTZ): a 6.5% fee until you stop delegating to us
* from 3 ro 5 rolls (24,000 XTZ to 40,000 XTZ): a 8% fee until you stop delegating to us

Any delegate above 5 rolls will get our standard rate yet to be determined, and which may fluctuate over time.

To determine which roll your delegation is a part of, we rely on the amount at the time of delegation based on the blockchain history. See our [delegation page on tezblock](https://mvp.tezblock.io/account/tz1gg5bjopPcr9agjamyu9BbXKLibNc2rbAq).

If you delegate more than one roll worth of XTZ, or if your delegation overlaps between two rolls, we will apply a rule of proportionality to determine your fee. For example, if we currently have exactly two rolls, and you delegate two rolls worth of XTZ (16,000 XTZ) at once to us, your fee will be 7.125% (6.5% for one roll and 8% for the other).

If you delegation brings us over the threshold of 5 rolls (40,000 XTZ), then we will apply a rule of proportionality between the discounted fee and the standard fee yet to be determined. The resulting fee will be lower than our standard rate yet to be determined, and may fluctuate over time.

Once we reach the limit of 5 rolls, we will post the resulting addresses and their associated fees as an update on our website.

The Super Launch Discount is subject to the [terms and conditions](terms-and-conditions), please read them carefully.
