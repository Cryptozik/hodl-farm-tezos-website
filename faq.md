## What is Tezos ?

Tezos is a delegated proof-of-stake cryptocurrency.

## What is delegation ?

Delegation is like putting your money in a savings account. By delegating to a baker such as Hodl.farm, you contribute to the health of the peer-to-peer network. Hodl.farm earns rewards for baking and endorsing blocks, and passes these rewards to you - minus a small fee.

## Is delegation safe ?

Delegation is an operation that does not change ownership of your assets. When you delegate to us, you still own your coins ! It is very important to realize that delegation does not equate transfer. Please do not send us money !

In order to delegate, you must have transferred your assets to an address under your control, which means that you possess a private key which grants access to your assets. Whether or not you delegate your Tezzies, you must take precautions to protect your private key. The most common protection is to use a hardware wallet such as Ledger or Trezor, or an offline, air-gapped device (running for example the AirGap app).

With great power comes great responsibility. When in doubt, do not attempt to delegate to us, leave your assets in a cryptocurrency website such as Coinbase.
