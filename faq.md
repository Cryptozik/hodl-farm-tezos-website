## What is Tezos ?

Tezos is a cryptocurrency. Specifically, it is a [delegated proof-of-stake cryptocurrency](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/DPoS).

[For more information, go to Tezos website](https://tezos.com).

## What is delegation ?

Delegation is like having your money in a savings account. By delegating to us, you help us bake and endorse more blocks. We earn rewards for that, and we pass them along to you - minus a small fee.

If your XTZ are on Coinbase, Kraken or any cryptocurrency exchange, you will not be able to delegate to us. To delegate, your assets must be in a wallet that you control.

Delegation is an operation on the blockchain that **does not change ownership** of your assets. When you delegate to us, you still own your coins ! Let that sink in: delegating is not the same as transfering. Please **do not send us your money** !

## Is delegation safe ?

In order to delegate, you must be in control of your XTZ address, which means that you own a private key which grants access to your assets. You must take precautions to protect your private key. Never send it to us, or anyone. We will never ask you for it.

The most common protection is to use a hardware wallet such as Ledger or Trezor, or an offline, air-gapped device (running for example the AirGap app).

Being in control of your address is like being your own bank. It gives you great powers, which come with great responsibility. When in doubt, do not attempt to delegate to us, leave your assets in a cryptocurrency website such as Coinbase.

For further reading, we recommend Ledger's [best practices when using a hardware wallet](https://www.ledger.com/academy/hardwarewallet/best-practices-when-using-a-hardware-wallet/). Read and ask yourself whether you want to go down that route. If yes, then buckle up and read on.

## How to delegate to you ?

There are many ways. Please check these excellent guides on Medium:

* [how to delegate with the Airgap app](https://medium.com/airgap-it/airgap-how-to-delegate-tezos-86c392809535)

## How reliable are you ?

Our infrastructure resides on a distributed Google Kubernetes Engine cluster, with the exception of the signers, which are kept under our control.

We pride ourselves in being the one and only fully auditable cloud baker ! All of our infrastructure is declared as code and [open-source](https://github.com/hodl-dot-farm).

We have built several layers of redundancy in the system, we have performed significant reliability and security due diligence. Our utmost concern is that you get your rewards on time.

## How can I contact you ?

Please get in touch by email at hello@hodl.farm. Telegram channel is coming soon.

## Do you support the Babylon Tezos update ?

Yes. To our knowledge, we are the first Babylon-native baker.

## What are the terms of your Super Launch Discount ?

Here is the fee you will be getting by taking advantage of the Super Launch Discount:

* right now our staking balance is 8,000 XTZ (one roll)
* if you are amongst our first delegators, you will get a **5% fee** until you stop delegating to us. This offer is valid until our staking balance (the total amount of XTZ delegated to us) reaches 2 rolls (16,000 XTZ of delegated funds).
* if you delegate after we reach that first threshold, you get added to the next tier: until we reach 3 rolls of staking balance (up to 24,000 XTZ), you will get a **6.5% fee** until you stop delegating to us
* if you delegate to us while our staking balance is between 3 and 5 rolls (24,000 XTZ to 40,000 XTZ), you will get a **8% fee** until you stop delegating to us

Any delegate after we reach 5 rolls will get our standard rate yet to be determined, and which may fluctuate over time.

Tezos baking and endorsing rights depends on how many "rolls" a baker has. A roll amounts to 8000 tezzies.

The more you delegate to us, the more rolls we have, and the more we can bake !

To determine which roll your delegation is a part of, we rely on the amount at the time of delegation based on the blockchain history. See our [delegation page on tezblock](https://mvp.tezblock.io/account/tz1gg5bjopPcr9agjamyu9BbXKLibNc2rbAq).

If you delegate more than one roll worth of XTZ, or if your delegation overlaps between two rolls, we will apply a rule of proportionality to determine your fee. For example, if our staking balance is currently 2 rolls (16,000 XTZ), and you delegate two rolls worth of XTZ (16,000 XTZ) at once to us, your fee will be 7.125% (6.5% for one roll and 8% for the other).

If you delegation brings us over the threshold of 5 rolls (40,000 XTZ), then we will apply a rule of proportionality between the discounted fee and the standard fee yet to be determined. The resulting fee will be lower than our standard rate, and may fluctuate over time. To lock in a fixed rate for life, **delegate now!**

Once we reach the limit of 5 rolls, we will post the resulting addresses and their associated fees as an update on our website.

The Super Launch Discount is subject to the [terms and conditions](terms-and-conditions), please read them carefully.
